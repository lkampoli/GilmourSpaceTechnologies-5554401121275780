\begin{abstract}
\noindent In this work package, a validation test case for the jet-on configuration was numerically investigated. Numerical simulations were conducted to characterize the expansion behavior of compressible turbulent jets at various NPRs and NTRs and results are reported for one combination. The main objective was to build up confidence in the numerical solutions obtained by OpenFOAM and FLUENT solvers for jet-dominated flows.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Testing different Nozzle Pressure Ratios (NPR) and Nozzle Temperature Ratios (NTR) is crucial in understanding the behavior of compressible turbulent jets, particularly in aerospace applications such as rocket propulsion systems. These ratios significantly influence jet expansion characteristics, shock wave formation, turbulence distribution, and overall flow dynamics. By varying NPR and NTR, researchers can investigate how changes in the thermodynamic conditions at the nozzle exit affect the jet’s interaction with the ambient environment. 

Higher NPR values typically result in more pronounced shock structures, increased turbulence kinetic energy, and greater jet instability, which are critical for predicting performance and mitigating acoustic loads. Similarly, variations in NTR impact the thermal loading on surrounding structures and alter turbulence development, especially within the mixing layer. Understanding these effects across a range of NPR and NTR values allows engineers to optimize nozzle designs, improve predictive models, and enhance the accuracy of computational simulations under diverse operational conditions. 

This study aims to validate numerical solvers, namely, OpenFOAM and ANSYS Fluent against experimental data and assess their capability to capture complex jet phenomena under varying pressure and temperature ratios. 

%This works briefly aims at:
%\begin{itemize}
    %\item Investigating the expansion characteristics of the jet under varying Nozzle Pressure Ratios (NPRs) and Nozzle Temperature Ratios (NTRs).
    %\item Comparing OpenFOAM and Fluent solvers on a complex test case involving turbulence and temperature effects.
    %\item Carrying out high-fidelity simulations of turbulent flows until the continuum assumption no longer holds.
    %\item Determining flow field and turbulence parameters of jets at relatively low ambient pressures.
%\end{itemize}

Table~\ref{tab:test_matrix} presents all the test cases collected for the present report. For TC1, TC2 and TC3, experimental results are available. Numerical results will be given for TC2 only.

\section{Numerical approach}\label{sec:numerics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this study, two numerical solvers were used: OpenFOAM and Ansys Fluent.

The open-source framework, OpenFOAM~\cite{opencfd2009open} utilizes a first-order explicit Euler scheme for time integration and employs a second-order semi-discrete central scheme by Kurganov~\cite{kurganov2000new}, complemented by the van Leer limiter for convective fluxes. The set of equations numerically solved coupled with the $k$-$\omega$ SST turbulence model are recalled in Figure~\ref{fig:OF}. Fluent solver settings are listed in Table~\ref{tab:solver_settings}. Boundary conditions adopted in Fluent are provided in Table~\ref{tab:bc_summary}. Material properties used in both solvers are given in Table~\ref{tab:material_properties}.

\section{Grid convergence}\label{sec:conv}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Three different grid resolutions were used: \uline{\textbf{coarse} with 244728 grid points}, \textbf{medium} with 353073 grid points, and \textbf{fine} with 418218 grid points to ensure the spatial convergence. Grid details are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:convergence_study}.

Figure~\ref{fig:convS} and~\ref{fig:convT}, respectively shows the spatial and temporal evolution of the temperature field on the three grid levels. It can be seen that 0.1 seconds is sufficient to achieve a time-convergent solution for this case.

Numerical simulation were first performed in OpenFOAM. OpenFOAM grids were then exported to Fluent mesh format using a converter utility~\cite{chitalov2021developing}. Results provided in this report were calculated on the coarse grid level.

\section{Results}\label{sec:results}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
With the intent of validating and build trust on the results obtained by the available numerical solvers, \textbf{Fluent} and \textbf{OpenFOAM}, for the Charon (and Eris) jet-ON configuration, additional test cases have been proposed and numerically investigated in the present report. In particular, the dynamics of jet expansion across a spectrum of nozzle pressure and temperature ratios was simulated.

Results for:
\begin{itemize}
    %\item TC1: NPR=1.1, NTR=1.813
    \item TC2: NPR=4.03, NTR=1.0
\end{itemize}
%NPR=1.1, NTR=1.813 and NPR=4.03, NTR=1.0 
are presented, whose detail initial conditions (ICs) are provided in Table~\ref{tab:test_matrix}. Experimental data is available %for both, respectively, in~\cite{seiner1992effects}

Numerical validation considered (magnitude) velocity, Mach, static temperature and pressure, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) fields. The numerical results obtained with Fluent and OpenFOAM were compared with other numerical solutions and available experimental data.

Figure~\ref{fig:cfd-comp} shows the absolute static pressure, axial velocity, static temperature and turbulent kinetic energy production fields calculated by OpenFOAM and Fluent on the same number of contour levels. A qualitative good agreement was achieved for all fields with small but appreciable differences. Since the computational mesh is exactly the same, as well as the turbulence model, such differences are imputable to the different order of the numerical scheme adopted in the two solvers and the implementation of the boundary conditions. To be noted that different BCs were imposed in the solvers to represent the same physics due to the way in which the solvers work.

Quantitative comparison of numerical solutions is shown in Figures~\ref{fig:p}-\ref{fig:tke}. A very good agreement was obtained for the pressure fields in Figure~\ref{fig:p} while temperature, velocity Mach and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) manifest some discrepancies. In particular, Figures~\ref{fig:vel_mag} and~\ref{fig:mach} compare numerical solutions with experimental data, for the velocity magnitude and Mach number, respectively. It can observed that Fluent tends to compute solutions in better agreement with experimental data, especially, at higher distance from the jet. This may point to the better dissipative/dispersive properties of the higher order scheme adopted in Fluent. Figure~\ref{fig:tke} reports the TKE profile along the centerline axis computed by the two solvers. It can be noted a lower peak of TKE production in Fluent, slightly shifted rightwards while showing a tail in good agreement with OpenFOAM.

Numerical validation considered (magnitude) velocity, Mach, static temperature and pressure, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) fields. The numerical results obtained with Fluent and OpenFOAM were compared with other numerical solutions and available experimental data.

The obtained numerical results shown a good qualitative and quantitative level of agreement between the two solvers. Fluent solutions appear to be in slightly better agreement with the experimental data.
